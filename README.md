GENERAL INFORMATION

This is a WIP low-level FTP-based honeypot,
designed as a jumping-off point for others
who want to create a honeypot from scratch,
albeit the honeypot is not as optimal as it
could be code-wise.
--------------------------------------------
RUNNING THE HONEYPOT

To run use 'sudo apt python3 ftp_honeypot2'
--------------------------------------------
CONFIGURING

Before starting the honeypot in the main menu
make sure to configure first, specifically 
"IP Address" and "Home Directory". These are
crucial for running the honeypot and must be 
configured beforehand.
